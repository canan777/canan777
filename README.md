<h2 align="center">Hello world🌍I'm Canan🌞</h2>

💻I'm studying online Web / Mobile (iOS and Android) programming with online React / React Native via Udemig, which provides training in Turkey, Sweden and many parts of the world. I worked as a Front-End developer and React Developer at Arabuleu in Paris, France. I am experienced in software development. I have contributed to many projects with more than two years of experience. I have mastered HTML, CSS, Javascript web technologies. 
                          
👯I am also a classroom teacher who likes to use computers and follows technology. 

🤖 Although my students are at a young age, I develop projects for them to use many web 2.0 tools. I teach web 2.0 tools on the smart board in the classroom and support them with homework, exercises and computer games on mobile. When programming languages on the computer started to attract my attention, I turned to this kind of training. Creating brand new projects by writing codes made me very excited and increased my curiosity. 


❤ I have a master's degree with a thesis from the Deparment of Classroom Education. I received the title of science expert in the field of "Autism". I was selected for a project in which only 33 teachers from Turkey were selected. We have a book called "Empathy School".

🏞 I paint oil paintings, give courses and open painting exhibitions with my students.

✈️ I am the coordinator of many eTwinning and Erasmus projects. I have received many national and international awards and degrees with the projects I have done. With Erasmus projects, I enable my fellow teachers and students to learn English and carry out projects. I develop their creativity. With the Erasmus project, I visited Finland for on-the-job training.

📝I have been the founder of more than thirty eTwininng projects working with foreign countries. I have won numerous European quality labels for my school in these international projects.

🎯I prefer to work as a team with team spirit and eliminate deficiencies together. I love working on innovative projects and problem solving. I am entrepreneurial and creative. I am focused on continuous learning and self-improvement.

🎨🏅📚In my free time I like to learn new things, do oil painting, read new books, do sports, spend time with my family and friends.

💫 Stay tuned to see my projects and learn more about me😉
