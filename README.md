                            Hi👋. I'm Canan GÜNEŞ AKGÜL
👯I am a classroom teacher who loves using computers and following technology.  
🌱I live in, Turkey.  
🤖 Although my students are at a young age, I develop projects for them to use many web 2.0 tools. I teach web 2.0 tools on the smart board in the classroom and support them with homework, exercises and computer games on mobile. When programming languages on the computer started to attract my attention, I turned to this kind of training. Creating brand new projects by writing codes made me very excited and increased my curiosity. I have learned HTML and CSS so far, but my biggest goal is to learn more different software programs.
☑ I started learning JavaScript.
❤ I have a master's degree with a thesis from the Deparment of Classroom Education. I received the title of science expert in the field of "Autism". I was selected for a project in which only 33 teachers from Turkey were selected. We have a book called "Empathy School".
☀ I paint oil paintings, give courses and open painting exhibitions with my students.
♕ Stay tuned to see my projects and learn more about me😉
